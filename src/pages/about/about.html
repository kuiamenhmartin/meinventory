              Hi, this is Kuiamenh! I'm happy to deploy this app written in Ionic framework which has basic functions (for now).
              Just an overview, I made this very basic app to handle operations in our small mini-store.
              It caters a small portion of a real inventory system which is to add, edit and delete products in the inventory.
              Through this, I can easily look for an item, check its price and that's it! Such a great relief on my part.

              Framework : Ionic 3 with Cordova
              Tools : Visual Studio, Android Emulator, Android Phone
            </p>
